      <description>What is a Success Manifest What is success really? What qualities make a successful person? What words contribute to this success? Persistence? Focus? Luck?
I created Success Manifest to document my experiences and advice on success from taking a single word and explaining how it relates to success. Following this article and many others, I will devote an entire episode focused on one word.
Here are some of its key components: - it’s focused- each article is focused on a single word rather than success in general.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites  Basic understanding of the HTTP protocol, Javascript, Node, and Express  What are Middlewares? From the documentation,
 Middlewares are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle.

 To give you a relatable picture, Express middleware&amp;rsquo;s are the workers in a manufacturing line where each individual has a specific and unique responsibility.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t Underestimate Stack overflow First off, this achievement may not be a ground-breaking feat but I was happy my approach to answering questions was increasing my reputation at a pretty fast rate. I&amp;rsquo;ve read articles how some people hacked their way to higher reputation but I am going to show you how I did it&amp;hellip; by giving a genuine helpful response as fast as I could after a question was posted.</description>

      <description>Projects On Point On Point is a geolocation-based Q&amp;amp;A where users ask and answer nearby questions in real-time. This full-stack application used React, Redux, Node, Express, WebSockets, and PostgreSQL.
The mission behind On Point was to provide users faster valuable responses to their questions about the environment around them. I found that users often have questions about their surroundings but struggle to find reliable answers fast enough. On Point was created to connect users with questions to users answers around them.</description>
