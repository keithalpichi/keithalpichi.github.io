        Hi, my name is Keith Alpichi. I am a software engineer who loves helping other software engineers become better at their jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a little about me:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I'm skilled in cloud-computing. I've architected AWS cloud infrastructures including managing servers and networks, creating server-less API's, utilizing both SQL and NoSQL databases, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm skilled in back-end development in languages such as NodeJS and Go (Golang).
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm skilled in front-end Javascript development using tools such as React and Redux. In 2017, I taught over 30 software engineers on React and Redux.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm deeply passionate about health, productivity, entrepreneurship, fitness, and nearly everything to do with the ocean.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm interested in simple yet intuitive UI's, server-less cloud computing, event-driven architectures and real-time distributed systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          I dream to someday start my own software company.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who I Am Outside of Work</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding I like to exercise, cook, enjoy new cuisines, make my own espresso, listen to reggae music, play some chords on my ukulele, go to the beach, and read. I like to think of myself as a California beach bum. If I could code with my feet in the sand on a beach in San Diego, I would!
