<h2 id="don-t-underestimate-stack-overflow">Don&rsquo;t Underestimate Stack overflow</h2>

<p>First off, this achievement may not be a ground-breaking feat but I was happy my approach to answering questions was increasing my reputation at a pretty fast rate. I&rsquo;ve read articles how some people hacked their way to higher reputation but I am going to show you how I did it&hellip; by giving a genuine helpful response as fast as I could after a question was posted.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty confident in Javascript, React, Redux, Node, and Express and I wanted to share my knowledge and experience with the community. However, I didn&rsquo;t know the best way to. I&rsquo;ve used Quora in the past for other types of questions (<a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Keith-Alpichi">I even received writing awards for it</a>) but for helping others with their technical questions there is no better place than Stack Overflow. I mean, SO was made for this.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-did-it">How I Did It</h2>

<ul>
<li>I made sure I understood <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation">the various ways Stack Overflow gives reputation points</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer">how to give good answers</a></li>
<li>I set a filter with Stack Exchange for questions with specific tags. When a new question was posted I could have Stack Exchange email me new questions with those tags within fifteen minutes</li>
<li>I downloaded the Stack Exchange mobile app and used that to add comments and answers when I wasn&rsquo;t using the browser</li>
<li>I strived to provide a genuine and helpful answer before someone else did</li>
<li>I strived to understand the question by leaving comments so I could provide a relevant and helpful response</li>
<li>I left external links relevant to the question <em>and</em> answer such as documentation, other SO posts, articles, and more</li>
<li>I formatted my responses to be readable because no one wants to read something they can&rsquo;t understand and follow</li>
</ul>

<p>Little by little my reputation started to rise. What&rsquo;s cool is that past answers continued to contribute to my reputation. This encouraged me to continue finding questions to answer. As a result I went from a reputation less than 100 to 550 within two months and made &ldquo;Top 8% This Year&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="set-your-filters-and-get-to-work">Set Your Filters and Get To work</h2>

<p>So go on, set your filters, and start answering. Together we can all provide quality answers to other software engineers who need them fast. We all know it sucks when we&rsquo;re coding, get stuck, and need answers quick. Be the person on the other end giving a great answer and you will be rewarded.</p>

<p>This may not be the most efficient approach but it worked for me and I enjoyed it. If you have any other tips or advice please let me know.</p>
