{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h4>Prerequisites</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic understanding of SASS or LESS and Webpack</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>LESS time, more SASS</h2>\n<p>That's what you want in your development workflow. Spend less time configuring and setting up and more time showing off your bad-ass styled applications. Here's a straight-forward explanation to configuring a preprocessor like SASS or LESS with Webpack.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I haven't tested it yet but the new version of Webpack (3) should still work with this setup</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Install your dependencies</h2>\n<p>You'll of course need Webpack and NPM or Yarn (I'll be using Yarn in this tutorial), so</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn add webpack\n</code></pre>\n<p>Install these:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn add style-loader css-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you're using SASS install:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn add sass-loader node-sass\n// node-sass is a peer dependency of SASS\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you're using LESS install:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yarn add less-loader\n</code></pre>\n<p>A quick overview of these packages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'*-loader' packages are responsible for compiling, injecting css scripts to the DOM, and resolving imports</li>\n<li>'extract-text-webpack-plugin' extracts multiple SASS or LESS files and builds them into a single file</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Configure Webpack</h2>\n<p>Create a 'webpack.config.js' in the root of your project directory if you don't already have one. Add the following lines:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">var path = require('path')\nvar webpack = require('webpack')\nvar ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: [\n    './path/to/entry/sass/or/less' // Footnote 1\n  ],\n  output: {\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'path/to/build') // Footnote 2\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.sass$/, // Footnote 3\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\n          fallback: 'style-loader',\n          use: ['css-loader', 'sass-loader'] // Footnote 4\n        })\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [new ExtractTextPlugin({ filename: 'index.css' })] // Footnote 5\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Configuration footnotes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Specify the path to the main entry point of the SASS or LESS file. This is where Webpack will look to start.</li>\n<li>Adjust the 'path' key to the directory you want Webpack to put the final css</li>\n<li>Adjust the 'test' key according to the preprocessor you're using, 'sass', 'scss', or 'less'</li>\n<li>Adjust the loader within the 'use' key to the preprocessor you're using, 'sass-loader' or 'less-loader'. Note that 'css-loader' must be defined first in the array because Webpack evaluates loaders from <em>right</em> to <em>left</em></li>\n<li>Adjust the 'filename' key to to the filename you want</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>That's it!</h2>\n<p>Make sure to reference the compiled css file in your 'index.html' file and you're good to go. With just a few lines of configuration you're Webpack is ready to compile your SASS or LESS. Now take the time you've saved to get a jump on styling your application!</p>\n<p>If you have any questions feel free to send me a tweet.</p>\n<h4>References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/configuration/\">webpack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin\">extract-text-webpack-plugin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader\">sass-loader</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader\">less-loader</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader\">style-loader</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader\">css-loader</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to setup SASS or LESS with Webpack 2","date":"2017-07-13T12:00:00Z"}}},"pageContext":{}}
