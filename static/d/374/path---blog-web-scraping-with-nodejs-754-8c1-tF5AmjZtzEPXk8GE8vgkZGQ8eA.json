{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>What is Web Scraping</h2>\n<p>There is one application every software engineer should build. That application is a web scraper. A web scraper is a service that programmatically requests and parses HTML content served from a remote server. Once you have the HTML content of a website you can parse it for specific data.</p>\n<p>In this article I'm going to show you how to build a web scraper to collect an ecommerce site's product inventory. It will give you a good grasp of the hypertext part of HTTP and how browsers use HTML to construct and parse the web pages you view and manipulate everyday.</p>\n<h2>Dependencies</h2>\n<p>There are few libraries we'll use to help us make web scraping a little easier.</p>\n<h3>Server-Side Language</h3>\n<p>Since we're requesting and parsing HTML programmatically we'll need a server-side language. We'll use NodeJS for this.</p>\n<h3>Parsing HTML</h3>\n<p>We'll also make the parsing work easier on ourselves by using jsdom. jsdom is a \"JavaScript implementation of various web standards, for use with Node.js\". This library allows us to perform common browser API commands to parse the HTML. We could proceed without it but then parsing the HTML would be much more difficult.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Scraping With NodeJS","date":"2020-05-19 08:00","tags":["nodejs"]}}},"pageContext":{}}
